### Secure Development Guidelines
```typescript
// Security-focused code comments and guidelines for development
interface SecureCodeGuidelines {
  // SECURITY RULE: Always validate and sanitize user input
  // DO NOT: Trust any external input without validation
  // POTENTIAL FLAW: SQL injection, XSS, command injection
  validateInput(input: string): boolean;
  
  // SECURITY RULE: Use parameterized queries for database operations
  // DO NOT: Concatenate user input directly into SQL queries
  // POTENTIAL FLAW: SQL injection attacks
  executeSecureQuery(query: string, params: any[]): Promise<any>;
  
  // SECURITY RULE: Implement proper authentication and authorization
  // DO NOT: Skip authentication checks or use weak authentication
  // POTENTIAL FLAW: Unauthorized access, privilege escalation
  authenticateUser(credentials: UserCredentials): Promise<AuthResult>;
  
  // SECURITY RULE: Always use HTTPS for sensitive communications
  // DO NOT: Transmit sensitive data over unencrypted connections
  // POTENTIAL FLAW: Man-in-the-middle attacks, data interception
  establishSecureConnection(endpoint: string): SecureConnection;
  
  // SECURITY RULE: Implement proper error handling without information leakage
  // DO NOT: Expose sensitive system information in error messages
  // POTENTIAL FLAW: Information disclosure, system reconnaissance
  handleSecureError(error: Error): SafeErrorResponse;
}

## 🏗️ Core Service Implementation

### 1. Authentication Service

#### JWT Token Implementation
```typescript
// backend/src/security/jwt.ts
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';
import bcrypt from 'bcrypt';
import { randomBytes } from 'crypto';

interface TokenPayload {
  userId: string;
  role: string;
  permissions: string[];
  sessionId: string;
}

export class JWTService {
  private readonly secret: string;
  private readonly refreshSecret: string;
  
  constructor() {
    this.secret = process.env.JWT_SECRET || randomBytes(64).toString('hex');
    this.refreshSecret = process.env.JWT_REFRESH_SECRET || randomBytes(64).toString('hex');
  }

  generateTokenPair(payload: TokenPayload) {
    const accessToken = jwt.sign(payload, this.secret, {
      expiresIn: '15m',
      algorithm: 'HS256',
      issuer: 'nova-dashboard',
      audience: 'nova-users'
    });

    const refreshToken = jwt.sign(
      { userId: payload.userId, sessionId: payload.sessionId },
      this.refreshSecret,
      { expiresIn: '7d' }
    );

    return { accessToken, refreshToken };
  }

  verifyToken(token: string): TokenPayload | null {
    try {
      return jwt.verify(token, this.secret) as TokenPayload;
    } catch (error) {
      return null;
    }
  }

  async hashPassword(password: string): Promise<string> {
    const saltRounds = 12;
    return bcrypt.hash(password, saltRounds);
  }

  async verifyPassword(password: string, hash: string): Promise<boolean> {
    return bcrypt.compare(password, hash);
  }
}
```

#### Multi-Factor Authentication
```typescript
// backend/src/security/mfa.ts
import speakeasy from 'speakeasy';
import QRCode from 'qrcode';

export class MFAService {
  generateSecret(userEmail: string) {
    return speakeasy.generateSecret({
      name: `Nova Dashboard (${userEmail})`,
      issuer: 'Nova Dashboard',
      length: 32
    });
  }

  async generateQR(secret: string): Promise<string> {
    return QRCode.toDataURL(secret);
  }

  verifyToken(token: string, secret: string): boolean {
    return speakeasy.totp.verify({
      secret,
      token,
      window: 2,
      time: 30
    });
  }

  generateBackupCodes(): string[] {
    return Array.from({ length: 10 }, () =>

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULES - WHAT NOT TO DO

### 🚫 ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS
1. **NEVER** skip security implementations - every feature must be secure by design
2. **NEVER** use outdated cryptography - only quantum-safe algorithms allowed
3. **NEVER** store secrets in plain text or code - always encrypt everything
4. **NEVER** implement features without proper testing - minimum 95% code coverage required
5. **NEVER** ignore cross-platform compatibility - support ALL major platforms
6. **NEVER** create monolithic code - use microservices architecture only
7. **NEVER** deploy without proper authentication - multi-factor auth required
8. **NEVER** skip input validation - sanitize and validate ALL user inputs
9. **NEVER** use insecure communication - TLS 1.3+ only, prefer quantum-safe protocols
10. **NEVER** ignore performance - every component must be optimized for speed and efficiency

### 🔒 SECURITY COMMANDMENTS
1. **Zero Trust**: Verify everything, trust nothing
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security required
3. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimum necessary permissions only
4. **Fail Secure**: System must fail to secure state, never insecure
5. **Security by Design**: Build security in, don't bolt it on later

        ]
        
        base_response = random.choice(responses)
        
        # Add recommendations
        if alert.recommendations:

## 🎯 Implementation Guidelines

### Development Security Notes
```python
# CRITICAL SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:

# 1. INPUT VALIDATION - ALWAYS validate and sanitize ALL inputs
def secure_input_validation(user_input):
    """
    SECURITY REQUIREMENT: Validate ALL user inputs
    - Whitelist allowed characters
    - Validate data types and ranges
    - Sanitize for injection attacks
    - Log validation failures
    """
    if not isinstance(user_input, str):
        raise ValueError("Invalid input type")
    
    # Remove potentially dangerous characters
    sanitized = re.sub(r'[<>"\';\\&]', '', user_input)
    
    # Validate length
    if len(sanitized) > 1000:
        raise ValueError("Input too long")
    
    return sanitized

# 2. ERROR HANDLING - NEVER expose sensitive information in errors
def secure_error_handling(operation):
    """
    SECURITY REQUIREMENT: Handle errors without information disclosure
    - Log detailed errors securely
    - Return generic error messages to users
    - Implement proper error recovery
    """
    try:
        return operation()
    except Exception as e:
        # Log detailed error securely
        secure_logger.error(f"Operation failed: {str(e)}", extra={'sensitive': True})
        
        # Return generic error to user
        return {"error": "Operation failed", "code": "GENERIC_ERROR"}

# 3. AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION - Implement proper access controls
def verify_access(user, resource, action):
    """
    SECURITY REQUIREMENT: Verify access for ALL operations
    - Authenticate user identity
    - Verify authorization for specific actions
    - Log access attempts
    - Implement rate limiting
    """
    if not authenticate_user(user):
        log_security_event("Failed authentication", user)
        return False
    
    if not authorize_action(user, resource, action):
        log_security_event("Unauthorized access attempt", user, resource, action)
        return False
    
    return True
```

### Performance Implementation Notes
```typescript
// PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION REQUIREMENTS:

// 1. ASYNC OPERATIONS - Use async/await for I/O operations
async function performAsyncOperation(data: any): Promise<Result> {
  try {
    // Use Promise.all for parallel operations
    const [result1, result2, result3] = await Promise.all([
      operation1(data),
      operation2(data),
      operation3(data)
    ]);
    
    return combineResults(result1, result2, result3);
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle errors properly
    handleAsyncError(error);
    throw error;
  }
}

// 2. CACHING - Implement intelligent caching
class IntelligentCache {
  private cache: Map<string, CacheEntry> = new Map();
  
  async get<T>(key: string, fetcher: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
    const cached = this.cache.get(key);
    
    if (cached && !this.isExpired(cached)) {
      return cached.value;
    }
    
    // Fetch fresh data
    const value = await fetcher();
    
    // Cache with TTL
    this.cache.set(key, {
      value,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      ttl: this.calculateTTL(key)
    });
    
    return value;
