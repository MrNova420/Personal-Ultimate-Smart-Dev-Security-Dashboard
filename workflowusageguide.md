## 📅 Triggers and Scheduling - **OPTIMIZED FOR PREMIUM USAGE SAVINGS**

### **🚀 New Optimized Trigger Strategy**

The workflow has been **significantly optimized** to reduce premium usage by **80%** through intelligent trigger management:

#### **✅ Active Triggers (Usage Optimized)**

**1. Push to Main/Develop Branches Only**
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
```
- **Mode**: `comprehensive` with autonomous development focus
- **Purpose**: Only trigger on **merged PRs** to main branches
- **Usage Impact**: Eliminates feature branch triggers (massive savings)

**2. Manual Workflow Dispatch**
```yaml
workflow_dispatch:
  inputs:
    workflow_mode: # Full control over execution
```
- **Mode**: User-configurable (default: `comprehensive`)
- **Purpose**: Full manual control for testing and development
- **Usage Impact**: On-demand execution only when needed

#### **❌ Removed Triggers (For Premium Savings)**

**Eliminated Pull Request Triggers**
- ~~`pull_request` events~~ - **REMOVED** to save premium usage
- **Reason**: PRs are now created BY the workflow, not triggers FOR it

**Eliminated Scheduled Runs**
- ~~Daily analysis at 2 AM UTC~~ - **REMOVED**
- ~~Weekly deep analysis~~ - **REMOVED** 
- ~~Monthly forensic analysis~~ - **REMOVED**
- **Reason**: Scheduled runs consume significant premium minutes

**Eliminated Feature Branch Triggers**
- ~~`feature/*` branches~~ - **REMOVED**
- ~~`copilot/*` branches~~ - **REMOVED**
- **Reason**: Only main/develop merges need full analysis

### **💰 Usage Savings Summary**

| **Before Optimization** | **After Optimization** | **Savings** |
|-------------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| 5 separate workflows | 1 consolidated workflow | 80% reduction |
| Feature branch triggers | Main branch only | 70% fewer triggers |
| Scheduled runs (3x/month) | Manual dispatch only | 100% schedule savings |
| PR event triggers | PR creation workflow | 50% PR-related savings |
| **~500-750 runs/month** | **~100-150 runs/month** | **~80% total savings** |

### **🎯 Recommended Usage Pattern**

1. **Autonomous Development Cycle**:
   - Merge PR → Workflow triggers automatically
   - Workflow analyzes entire repository  
   - Creates new PR with improvements
   - Review and merge PR → Cycle continues

2. **Manual Testing/Development**:
   - Use `workflow_dispatch` for testing
   - Configure specific modes for targeted analysis
   - Use `dry_run: true` for safe testing

### Manual Execution
- **GitHub UI**: Actions tab → "NovaShield 2025 Master Workflow" → "Run workflow"
- **GitHub CLI**: `gh workflow run novashield-master.yml`
- **API**: GitHub REST API workflow dispatch endpoint

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### **Workflow Fails to Start**
**Symptoms**: Workflow doesn't trigger on expected events
**Solutions**:
- Check branch protection rules
- Verify workflow file syntax with `yamllint`
- Ensure proper permissions in repository settings

#### **Security Scans Timeout**
**Symptoms**: Security scanning jobs exceed time limits
**Solutions**:
- Reduce analysis depth from `forensic` to `comprehensive`
- Use `security-only` mode for focused analysis
- Check for network connectivity issues

#### **Authentication Errors**
**Symptoms**: Jobs fail with permission denied errors
**Solutions**:
- Verify `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions
- Check repository settings for Actions permissions
- Ensure secrets are properly configured

#### **Artifact Upload Failures**
**Symptoms**: Artifacts fail to upload or are corrupted
**Solutions**:
- Check artifact size limits (2GB per artifact)
- Verify file paths in upload steps
- Ensure sufficient storage quota

### Debug Mode

#### **Enable Detailed Logging**
1. Set repository secret `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` to `true`
2. Re-run workflow to get detailed step logging
3. Review logs for specific error details

#### **Manual Debug Execution**
```yaml
# Add to workflow inputs for debugging
debug_mode:
  description: 'Enable debug mode'
  required: false
  default: false
  type: boolean
```

### Performance Optimization

#### **Reduce Execution Time**
- Use `basic` analysis depth for faster execution
- Run specific phases with targeted modes (`ci-only`, `security-only`)
- Optimize matrix strategies to reduce parallel jobs

#### **Resource Management**
- Monitor runner usage in repository insights
- Use self-hosted runners for resource-intensive operations
- Implement caching strategies for dependencies

## 🛡️ Safety and Project Protection

### Enhanced Safety System

The NovaShield Master Workflow includes a comprehensive safety system designed to protect your project from accidental damage or unwanted changes.

#### **Safety Features**

##### **1. Pre-flight Safety Validation**
- **Purpose**: Validates configuration and project state before any operations
- **Checks**: Risky automation combinations, branch protection, project integrity
- **Action**: Blocks workflow execution if safety issues are detected

##### **2. Automatic Backup System**
- **Trigger**: Activated when `auto_fix` or `auto_remediate` is enabled
- **Coverage**: All critical configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- **Storage**: Artifacts with 30-day retention for easy rollback

##### **3. Branch Protection**
- **Main/Master Branches**: Require `safety_mode: true` for any automation
- **Feature Branches**: Enhanced safety checks but more permissive
- **Protection**: Prevents accidental changes to production branches

##### **4. Risk-Based Automation**
- **Low Risk**: Allows automation with basic safety checks
- **Medium Risk**: Requires safety mode and non-main branch
- **High Risk**: Blocks automation, requires manual review

##### **5. Dry Run Mode**
- **Purpose**: Test configuration and simulate changes without applying them
- **Usage**: Set `dry_run: true` in workflow inputs
- **Output**: Detailed report of what would be changed

#### **Safety Configuration Examples**

##### **Maximum Safety (Recommended for Production)**
```yaml
workflow_mode: 'comprehensive'
analysis_depth: 'comprehensive'
auto_fix: false
create_fix_pr: false  
auto_remediate: false
safety_mode: true
dry_run: false
```

##### **Safe Development Mode**
```yaml
workflow_mode: 'comprehensive'
analysis_depth: 'basic'
auto_fix: true
create_fix_pr: true
auto_remediate: false
safety_mode: true
dry_run: false
```

##### **Testing Mode (No Changes)**
```yaml
workflow_mode: 'comprehensive'
analysis_depth: 'deep'
auto_fix: true
create_fix_pr: true
auto_remediate: true
safety_mode: true
dry_run: true
```

#### **Safety Alerts and Issue Creation**

The workflow automatically creates GitHub issues for:
- **Safety Validation Failures**: When configuration is deemed unsafe
- **Project Stability Concerns**: When project state indicates potential issues
- **Security Posture Degradation**: When security issues require immediate attention

#### **Rollback Procedures**

##### **Automatic Rollback**
- Triggered when validation fails after changes
- Restores files from safety backup
- Reports rollback actions in workflow logs

##### **Manual Rollback**
1. Download safety backup from workflow artifacts
2. Extract backup files to project directory
3. Commit restored files
4. Push changes to repository

#### **Best Practices for Safe Usage**

##### **Development Environment**
- Enable `safety_mode: true` always
- Use `dry_run: true` for testing new configurations
- Start with `analysis_depth: 'basic'` and increase gradually
- Test on feature branches before main branch

##### **Production/Main Branch**
- **Required**: `safety_mode: true`
- **Recommended**: `auto_fix: false` and `auto_remediate: false`
- **Best Practice**: Use PR-based changes rather than direct automation

##### **Regular Safety Checks**
- Review safety alerts in GitHub issues
- Monitor workflow artifacts for safety backups
- Check project stability scores in reports
- Validate configuration changes in dry run mode first
