## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RULES - WHAT NOT TO DO

### üö´ ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS
1. **NEVER** skip security implementations - every feature must be secure by design
2. **NEVER** use outdated cryptography - only quantum-safe algorithms allowed
3. **NEVER** store secrets in plain text or code - always encrypt everything
4. **NEVER** implement features without proper testing - minimum 95% code coverage required
5. **NEVER** ignore cross-platform compatibility - support ALL major platforms
6. **NEVER** create monolithic code - use microservices architecture only
7. **NEVER** deploy without proper authentication - multi-factor auth required
8. **NEVER** skip input validation - sanitize and validate ALL user inputs
9. **NEVER** use insecure communication - TLS 1.3+ only, prefer quantum-safe protocols
10. **NEVER** ignore performance - every component must be optimized for speed and efficiency

### üîí SECURITY COMMANDMENTS
1. **Zero Trust**: Verify everything, trust nothing
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security required
3. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimum necessary permissions only
4. **Fail Secure**: System must fail to secure state, never insecure
5. **Security by Design**: Build security in, don't bolt it on later

## üîß IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES FOR COPILOT

### File Organization Rules
1. **Follow PROJECT_STRUCTURE_TEMPLATE.md exactly** - no deviations allowed
2. **Use consistent naming conventions** - kebab-case for files, camelCase for variables
3. **Implement proper separation of concerns** - each service has single responsibility
4. **Maintain clear module boundaries** - no cross-contamination between services
5. **Document every major function and class** - self-documenting code required

### Code Quality Standards
1. **Minimum 95% test coverage** - no exceptions
2. **All functions must be typed** - TypeScript/Python type hints required
3. **Implement proper error handling** - never let errors go uncaught
4. **Use async/await patterns** - no callback hell allowed
5. **Follow security coding guidelines** - input validation, output encoding, secure defaults

### Security Implementation Standards
1. **Encrypt everything at rest and in transit** - use quantum-safe algorithms
2. **Implement defense in depth** - multiple security layers required
3. **Use secure defaults** - system must be secure out of the box
4. **Validate all inputs** - never trust user input
5. **Log all security events** - comprehensive audit trail required
