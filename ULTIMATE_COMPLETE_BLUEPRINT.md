 * @param {Object} options - Authentication options
 * @param {boolean} options.rememberMe - Create persistent session
 * @param {string} options.userAgent - Client user agent string
 * 
 * @returns {Promise<AuthResult>} Authentication result object
 * 
 * @throws {AuthenticationError} When credentials are invalid
 * @throws {RateLimitError} When too many attempts made
 * 
 * @security This function handles sensitive user credentials
 * @security Implements rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
 * @security Logs all authentication attempts for security monitoring
 * 
 * @example
 * const result = await authenticateUser('john_doe', 'secure_password', {
 *   rememberMe: true,
 *   userAgent: 'Mozilla/5.0...'
 * });
 */
```

#### 🧪 Testing Guidelines

**Test Structure**
```javascript
describe('Authentication System', () => {
  describe('User Login', () => {
    beforeEach(() => {
      // Setup test database and mock services
    });

    it('should authenticate valid credentials', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });

    it('should reject invalid credentials', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });

    it('should implement rate limiting', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });

    it('should log security events', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
});
```

#### 🔒 Security Guidelines

**Secure Coding Practices**
```python
# Input validation example
def validate_user_input(user_input: str) -> str:
    """
    Validates and sanitizes user input to prevent injection attacks.
    
    Security checks:
    - Length validation (max 1000 characters)
    - Character whitelist enforcement
    - SQL injection pattern detection
    - XSS payload detection
    - Command injection prevention
    """
    if not isinstance(user_input, str):
        raise ValidationError("Input must be string")
    
    if len(user_input) > 1000:
        raise ValidationError("Input too long")
    
    # Implement comprehensive validation logic
    sanitized_input = sanitize_input(user_input)
    return sanitized_input
```
